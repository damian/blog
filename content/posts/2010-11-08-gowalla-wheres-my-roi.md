I first signed up to <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> early this year, but left my account untouched, just to see whether any of location based services would catch on.

Fast forward to August, and for some reason I felt the urge to give Gowalla a try, in the hopes that it would compliment my other social media outlets.

I opted for Gowalla over the <a href="http://foursquare.com/">other one</a> out of my respect for <a href="http://maxvoltar.com/">Tim Van Damme's</a> work. I've been a follower of Tim's work for some time now and his freelance stuff on Gowalla's website is very nice. Because of this I figured Gowalla would at least be aesthetically pleasing. A few minutes later I downloaded the iPhone app and away I went.

Over the past few months, I've checked in a whole bunch of times, added friends, earned a few badges and even added some new spots. However there's one question that I seem to be asking myself lately, now that I've used Gowalla for a considerable amount of time.

### What value is Gowalla providing?

It turns out, *absolutely nothing!*

As far as I'm concerned, Gowalla is a *one-way broadcast*, with *no interaction between users*. There's *nothing new to discover* and the game mechanics are *quite pathetic*.

I'm close to deleting the app and leaving my account to expire, but before I do, I wanted to get a feel for other peoples opinions of Gowalla, and location based services in general. Are you finding they have any utility?
