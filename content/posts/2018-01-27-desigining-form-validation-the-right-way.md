Last week I had the privilege of speaking at [FrontEndNorth](https://frontendnorth.com/) in Sheffield. The talk I gave was heavily based on the one [I gave at JavaScript North East]({{< relref 2017-11-02-making-sure-your-forms-dont-suck >}}) in November(with some obvious refinements) about the challenges posed to end users and developers when working with inline validation. I was able to share my experiences on both ends of the spectrum and how we can alleviate these challenges by using [React](https://reactjs.org/) along with some smart design decisions to prevent alienating users of the applications we build. Finally I shared some best practices about how to better design forms so attendees can use this knowledge when building out web forms in the future.

A lot of the concepts behind this talk are the basis of *ConferizeForm*\* which is the library we're using to build out our web forms in the next iteration of [Conferize](https://www.conferize.com). This library will be Open Source in the near future, so stay tuned for an announcement about that!

I would like to take this opportunity to thank [Kimb](https://twitter.com/mkjones) and the organisers behind FrontEndNorth for having me, and putting on a great conference. Secondly I would like to thank Conferize for permitting me to share some of our learnings and how we've been able to get around them.

I've posted a copy of my slides below for anyone interested.
