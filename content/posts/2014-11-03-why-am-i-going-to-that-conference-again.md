In order of priority I’ve outlined **my main reasons** for attending a technical conference.

* To learn from the experiences of others
* To be introduced to new topics
* To learn about new tooling, products, libraries or approaches
* To be inspired

Networking is also a big reason I’m there but I just want to keep this strictly about the talks.

After attending a number of conferences in the past five years, its become clear to me that **this is not the order in which conference organisers curate their list of speakers and talks around**. In fact I’d go so far to say that organisers **heavily lean toward choosing inspirational or self promotional talks**.

I understand this to a degree. Conferences are a risky business and lining up big speakers helps fill up the seats. But I’m concerned that **this bias has become acceptable** and ‘the norm’ in the conference scene. Unfortunately its having the opposite effect on me, and on others who I’ve spoken to.

I don’t think I’m alone in reiterating that delegates **are there to learn first and foremost**. Its the very reason why most employers are happy to foot the bill and pay for the associated travel costs for their workers. **Attendees want to leave feeling inspired, but mostly they want to leave having learnt something new**.
