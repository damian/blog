At the beginning of 2017 I wrote down this list of goals for the year. Unlike prior years I tried to be more realistic about what I'd like to achieve versus what's actually possible. Upon reflection I don't think I did too bad since I managed three out of four.

## Run a marathon

I ran the [Great North Run](http://www.greatrun.org/great-north-run) in 2016 and really enjoyed it. The event itself was a blast and I felt within myself when I completed it(I was out running the very next day). I figured this is as good as time as any to enter for a marathon as I may never get back to this sort of form and level of running fitness.

After a few months of training I completed the [Edinburgh marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/) in May which was a huge achievement for me and one item checked off the bucket list.

## Write a blog post a month

This will be my twelfth post of the year so I managed to nail this one too. Writing is a skill and something that I find I have to work at, but once it's done I feel a sense of catharis and relief. Blogging here is something that I plan to continue with in 2018.

## Release two new open source projects

Perhaps I was a little ambitious on this one as I only managed to release [js-routes-rails](https://github.com/damian/js-routes-rails) as [I outlined]({{< relref 2017-02-02-js-routes-rails >}}) early last year. Still contributing one Open source project is better than none at all!

## Read one book a month

I **failed miserably** at reading this year and feel guilty for it. I read one book in December and managed to get about 50% of the way through three others throughout the year before putting them down. I plan to knuckle down and read at least a book every two month in 2018.

Some other cool things happened for me both personally and professionally in 2017, which include:

- Being at Nasdaq for the Conferize IPO was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm thrilled to be along for the ride
- Speaking at FrontendNE on [Chrome DevTools]({{< relref 2017-07-07-chrome-devtools >}}) and JavaScript North East about [Making sure your forms don't suck]({{< relref 2017-11-02-making-sure-your-forms-dont-suck >}})
- Learning how to solve a Rubik's cube
- Doing a fair bit of travelling to places like Disneyland Paris with my family, Sorrento for my cousins wedding, catching a bit of sun in Portugal, enjoying some Guiness for a weekend in Dublin and finally Copenhagen a few times to get together at Conferize HQ
