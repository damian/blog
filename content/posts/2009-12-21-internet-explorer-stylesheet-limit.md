Did you know that IE [ignores all style tags](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262161) after the first 30 requests?

This had me scratching my head last week as I couldn't fathom out why certain styles weren't being applied to a lightbox in Internet Explorer, but were working just fine in all other browsers.

I figure IE inconsistencies like the [double margin bug](http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/doubled-margin.html), [png fix](http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6) and [z-index issue](http://brenelz.com/2009/02/03/squish-the-internet-explorer-z-index-bug/) all to be common knowledge amongst web developers and designers. But why not this one? Surely the repercussions of this have more of a profound effect on a website?
