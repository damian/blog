After a fair bit of digging I found it's possible using the [Philips Hue
Bluetooth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue-bluetooth/id1456604186)
application to factory reset the bulbs without needing to purchase a hub or
remote. This has enabled me to repair my Zigbee devices in Home Assistant
through [Zigbee2MQQT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) as I've migrated away from
Phoscon.
