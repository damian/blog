A snippet of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">nginx</a> config file showing how to rewrite all urls from www.yourdomain.com to yourdomain.com.

Very simple, but worth knowing if opting for nginx over <a href="http://www.apache.org/">apache</a>.

{% highlight ruby %}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name www.damiannicholson.com;
  rewrite ^(.*) http://damiannicholson.com$1 permanent;
}


server {
  listen 80;
  server_name damiannicholson.com;
  ...
}

{% endhighlight %}
