description: Who knew that Internet Explorer had a restriction on the number of stylesheets it would load into a page, before ignoring the rest!

<p>Did you know that IE <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262161">ignores all style tags</a> after the first 30 requests?</p>

<p>This had me scratching my head last week as I couldn't fathom out why certain styles weren't being applied to a lightbox in Internet Explorer, but were working just fine in all other browsers.</p>

<p>I figure IE inconsistencies like the <a href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/doubled-margin.html">double margin bug</a>, <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6">png fix</a> and <a href="http://brenelz.com/2009/02/03/squish-the-internet-explorer-z-index-bug/">z-index issue</a> all to be common knowledge amongst web developers and designers. But why not this one? Surely the repercussions of this have more of a profound effect on a website?</p>
