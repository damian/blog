title: Ruby Date format gotcha

description: "I recently upgraded a Rails application that I've been working on from version 2.3.8 to 3.0.3. Since the newer releases of Rails support Ruby 1.9, I thought this would be an ideal opportunity to take advantage of the performance improvements both these updates provide."

Here's a little gotcha that I came across when parsing Date strings for insertion into a mysql date field.

{% highlight ruby %}

puts Date.parse('12/10/2010')
puts Date.parse('12/1/2010')

{% endhighlight %}

In Ruby 1.8.7 you'll get the following output:

{% highlight ruby %}

2010-12-10
2010-12-01

{% endhighlight %}

Though in Ruby 1.9.2 you'll get this:

{% highlight ruby %}

2010-10-12
2010-01-12

{% endhighlight %}

A little Ruby date format gotcha to look out for, as it took me a little time to hunt this sucker down.
