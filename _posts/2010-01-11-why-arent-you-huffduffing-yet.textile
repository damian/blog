description: A service built by Jeremy Keith of Clearleft, Huffduffer allows its users to aggregate and discover audio clips from around the web into an RSS feed. Really cool stuff!

<p>Lets face it - finding interesting and information rich podcasts in a certain niche is hard work. The web is filled with podcast directories with no easy way to sift through the noise.</p>

<h3>Enter Huffduffer</h3>
<p>A service built by <a href="http://clearleft.com/">Clearleft's</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a> is a social tagging tool for audio files. Think of it as a Delicious for MP3s, but better.</p>

<p>Because the service is home to audio files that interest mostly web folk(but not restricted to), it makes discovering new content in my industry a lot easier.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://huffduffer.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-267 aligncenter" title="Huffduffer Homepage" src="http://damiannicholson.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Screen-shot-2010-01-10-at-14.51.20.png" alt="" width="521" height="284" /></a></p>

<p>The icing on the cake is how Huffduffer deals with any content that gets my attention. By Huffduffing an MP3, it aggregates this into a single podcast which can be subscribed to in iTunes. Any audio file found on the web can be Huffduff'd and added to this podcast.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of support either, as both the handy bookmarklet and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13448">Firefox plugin</a> allow you to Huffduff any MP3s you may stumble across while browsing the web.</p>

<p>So why aren't you <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffing</a> yet?</p>
