description: A service built by Jeremy Keith of Clearleft, Huffduffer allows its users to aggregate and discover audio clips from around the web into an RSS feed. Really cool stuff!

Lets face it - finding interesting and information rich podcasts in a certain niche is hard work. The web is filled with podcast directories with no easy way to sift through the noise.
h3. Enter Huffduffer

A service built by Clearleft's <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>, <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a> is a social tagging tool for audio files. Think of it as a Delicious for MP3s, but better.

Because the service is home to audio files that interest mostly web folk(but not restricted to), it makes discovering new content in my industry a lot easier.

The icing on the cake is how Huffduffer deals with any content that gets my attention. By Huffduffing an MP3, it aggregates this into a single podcast which can be subscribed to in iTunes. Any audio file found on the web can be Huffduff'd and added to this podcast.

There's no shortage of support either, as both the handy bookmarklet and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13448">Firefox plugin</a> allow you to Huffduff any MP3s you may stumble across while browsing the web.

So why aren't you <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffing</a> yet?
