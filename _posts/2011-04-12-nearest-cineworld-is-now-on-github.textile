"As promised":/posts/project-nearest-cineworld, the codebase that powers the "Nearest Cineworld":http://nearest-cineworld.co.uk is now "on GitHub":https://github.com/damian/nearest-cineworld.

It's a noddy little app, since most of the heavy lifting is done through a bunch of Rake tasks that are triggered via Cron to pull in new films, and performance details for each cinema. 

Obviously it uses the "Cineworld gem":/posts/ruby-gem-cineworld I built. In addition to that it's the first project I've used "HAML":http://haml-lang.com/ from the start and also the "960gs":http://960.gs/. Both are worth follow up blog posts, so I won't go in to any more detail here. Suffice to say, if you've got half an hour to spare, it's certainly worth looking in to HAML or "Slim":https://github.com/stonean/slim. Going back to ERB is just painful to me now.
